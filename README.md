## Responsive Images Blog

#### About

The project is based on [Udacity's Responsive Images course](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882).

#### Course Project Requirements

###### Part 1

- Make the `<img>`s fit within their containers
- Make the containers a reasonable width (recommend 50em)
- Resize and compress images such that they remain sharp but the size of the page drops below 1.5MB. Make sure you use automation tools!
- Optional: Add captions

###### Part 2

- Replace the smiley face image with a unicode smiley face
- Replace the flourish with a markup technique or vector graphic
- Add social media icons for Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Digg to the bottom of the page
- Optional: Add your own SVG logo

###### Part 3

- Use `<picture>` with `srcset` to deliver images based on browser width and display density
- Add `alt` attributes to images with meaning
- Optional: Try a new font and style the text better!

For all parts: Don't forget to test on different devices and network settings!
